            <p>Some sound wakes you up from your dreams. It’s the sound of two children eating away at your house! 
                As you step outside and take a good look at the children, 
                you realize that the children seem very malnourished and they actually seem somewhat familiar. 
                What do you do?

                You turn away the children. 
                The children slowly leave your gingerbread house, and you soon find yourself alone in your house.
                You continue living your life in peace, 
                but there seems to be a loneliness that always permeates your sense of being...

                You bring in the two children to your gingerbread house.
                You realize that these are the hungry-looking children you saw just last month.
                The older boy introduces himself as Hansel, 
                and the younger girl introduces herself as Gretel.
                Because you have made the decision to bring in the siblings, you are now responsible for them!
                This means greater responsibilities but also new options and events for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will now be paying 150 gold a month to take care of these children,
                and you will now have new choices for how to spend your month.
                Choose wisely.

            <p>
                You are at the marketplace with the children, 
                where you overhear the stepmother brag to her friends how she got rid of her “rotten little step-brats.” 
                Hansel and Gretel is with you, and they make an expression that tells you that they also heard the stepmother. 
                What do you do? 
            </p>
            <div id="choices">

        <div class="non-main" id="candy-screen">
            <p>
                With a little flick of your hand, the stepmother is turned into a candy wrapper.
                You turn to the children and tell them that their stepmother has gotten what she deserves.
                They seem somewhat relieved and disturbed at the same time.
                They thank you, but something tells you that you have also sparked fear within their minds...
            </p>

        <div class="non-main" id="console-screen">
            <p>
                You immediately get the children away from the stepmother and console them.
                You tell them that they have done nothing wrong and reassure them that they are perfectly fine children,
                and that you will never treat them the way their stepmother did.
                Hand in hand, the three of you return to your gingerbread home.

        <div class="non-main" id="ignore-screen">
            <p>
                Not wanting to stir trouble, you ignore the stepmother and continue on the way with the children,
                pretending to not have heard anything.
                The children do the same, but the way back home seems more silent that usual...
            </p>
            <button class="continue-6mo">Continue</button>

        <div class="non-main" id="ending-intro-screen">
            <p>
                You hear a knock and see Hansel and Gretel’s father by the door. 
                He thanks you for taking care of the children thus far. 
                The father seems to regret his decisions and wishes to take his children back. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You open your mouth too say something, but you make eye contact with the children.
                That is when you realize that the matter has left your hands.
                You decide that the matter is now left up to the children,
                and the children will make their decision based on the last twelve months they have spent with you...

            Your plan of selling sweets has been going well, and 
            even after just a few weeks, the word spreads 
            that the villagers joke that one is able to estimate how much a child of the town is pampered 
            just by looking at how much weight the child has gained since the arrival of the witch--that's you!

            As you happily wrap up work for the day and start on your way back home,
            you encounter two teenagers--based on their appearances, they seem to be siblings.
            They are both very thin and seem to be quite hungry. What do you do?
        </p>
        <div id="choices">
            <button class="choice" id="approach">
                You approach the children and share some sweets with them.
            </button>
            <button class="choice" id="ignore">
                You are tired from the day that you decide to ignore the children and hurry back home to rest.
            </button>

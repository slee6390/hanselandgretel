            Great! You will focus on work for this month to earn money.
            Your game plan is to make a living by selling sweets to the children in the nearby town. 
            This goes well and earns you 200 gold. But working is also a tiring task! You lose 20 stamina.
        </p>
        <p>
            But you have to use money for yourself for the month as well. 
            An individual uses 50 gold per month. 
            Thus, your current sum is at 100 gold!
            Keep this in mind as you continue on in the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, depending on your choices and stats, a special event might occur for the month.
            For this month, you make a special encounter when you are out in the town selling your sweets...

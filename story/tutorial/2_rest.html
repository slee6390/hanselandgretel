            Great! Now you have restored your stamina. 
            Your stamina maxes out at 100 and decreases whenever you decide to focus on other activities for that week.
            Your health may be affected once your stamina is low, so be aware!
            In order to regain stamina, you should allow yourself to rest at times.
